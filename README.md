## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop an application for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. It helps the pharmacist to maintain the records of the medicines/drugs and supplies sent in by the supplier. The admin who are handling the organization will be responsible to manage the record of the employee. Each employee will be given with a separate username and password. The users can communicate each other by using a built-in messaging system. Pharmacy management system deals with the maintenance of drugs and consumables in the pharmacy unit. It application can generate invoices, bills, receipts etc.

## System Design
The system architecture of the Pharmacy Management System is designed to ensure scalability, robustness, and ease of maintenance. The architecture follows a multi-tier approach, consisting of the following layers:
- **Presentation layer:** This layer includes the user interface components, facilitating interaction between the users and the system. The technologies used in this layer include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a server-side language like PHP.
- **Application layer:** This layer contains the business logic and functionalities of the system, implemented using PHP.
- **Data later:** This layer manages data storage and retrieval, using a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL. It includes database schemas, tables, and relationships.

## Code Structure
The code first starts with open a connection to the MySQL database through an open connection with a database Handler through databaseHandler.inc.php with $pdo as the variable we use to interact with the database. First, we set up the connection to the database with mysql_connect command and set $pdo as a new PDO variable.

Next, we initiate a session cookie and create a _SESSION variable that store all the information in that session. We set the session's configuration through config_session.inc.php, in which we set the session's parameter such as lifetime, domain, path, etc... Then we start the session and regenerate the session based on if the user is logged in or not.

The above implementations are set in the include folder and alongside with login, signin and logout functionalities as they are heavily involved with the user's session. Beside that, all the system functionality are separated with each other as they are in their own designated folder. For example, all code base that involved with the creation, editing and viewing of invoice are stored in the invoice folder. The same are assumed with  the other functionalities except stated otherwise.
